# Godot Cutscenes
Cutscene and dialog system for Godot 3.0

Cutscenes are difficult to orchestrate when there's a combination of animations, movements, dialog, and player input.
This cutscene system manages concurrency across any number of user-defined cutscene events while providing a cutscene
language that is both human-readable and godot-compatable. See narrator/Dialog.gd for an implementation using the provided
dialog system.
